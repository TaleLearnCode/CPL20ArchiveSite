          Do bugs speak?
Yes, they do. People speak different languages like English, German, French, Chinese etc. But is communication to bugs possible? It is important to understand them, because they really tell something to us. There are valuable information underlying the bugs of a software, and information mining from bugs promises for improvements in terms of quality, time, effort and cost.

A comprehensive analysis on all created bugs can provide precious insights about the product. For instance; if we notice that a bunch of bugs heaps together on a feature, we can conclude that the feature should be investigated and cured. Or we can make some observations about the severities or assignees of similar bugs. Therefore, there are some potential patterns to be discovered under bugs.   

Every possible solution, which can help people, is tried to be adapted to project life cycles. Machine-based intelligence is one of the most exciting candidates. Since it is already known that machine learning (ML) applications started to overperform human beings; they can be utilized to reduce manual effort and cost. 

In this presentation, usage of ML in bug management is discussed. Objective of the talk is: 
a)	To present in which ways bugs can be analyzed
b)	To present how ML can be used to make observations over bugs
c)	To provide empirical information supporting (b)


ML & Bug Management are interesting topics which can make great attention. As more and more researchers try to use AI techniques to solve the traditional software problems, what and how we can use it is a crucial issue. Some guides are needed for both AI and software engineering researchers, so as this talk does. Especially mining valuable information from bugs can be made use of by managers to guide feature priorities. 

The talk consists of practical real-life experiences rather than theoretical claims. Effects of solutions are analyzed with before-after situations. Instead of what to do, it tells how to do.
Points that were taken into consideration for the talk:
•	It is well organized and easy-to-follow.
•	It is not case-specific. Context is applicable to any environment. 
•	Technical & management context balance: It will not include too much technical detail, or it will not be too weak in terms of background for the ideas.



Proposed approaches can be applied by any organization by adapting according to the related work to achieve time and cost reduction. In this way, key learnings will be covered such as:
•	How to learn from bugs.
•	How to detect bugs in early stages. 
•	How to manage bugs properly. 
•	Maintenance effort reduction.
